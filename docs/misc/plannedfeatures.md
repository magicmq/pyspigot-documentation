- [ ] Script loading delay on a per-script basis
- [ ] Support for scripts on Waterfall and Velocity proxy server
- [ ] Add more example scripts
- [x] Support for multi-file projects
- [x] Add example script that demonstrates how to create a GUI menu
- [x] Support for scripts on BungeeCord proxy server
- [x] Support for MySQL, Postgres, MonogDB, redis, and other databases
- [x] Per-script metrics (uptime, number of listeners registered, commands registered, etc.) that can be viewed via command
- [x] Ability to create and send packets via protocol manager (through ProtocolLib)
- [x] Allow scripts to stop themselves as well as start/stop other scripts (via script manager)
- [x] Per-script logging (log to file as well as to console for each script)
