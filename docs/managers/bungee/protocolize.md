# Working with Protocolize

???+ warning

    The Protocol manager is an *optional* manager. This manager should only be accessed if the Protocolize plugin is present on the BungeeCord proxy server when the PySpigot plugin is enabled.

PySpigot includes a manager that interfaces with Protocolize if you would like to work with packets in your script.

For instructions on importing the placeholder manager into your script, visit the [General Information](../usage.md) page.
