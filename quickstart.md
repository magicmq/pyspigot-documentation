# Quick Start Guide

Here is a very brief guide for creating your very first PySpigot script.

## Download and Load PySpigot

Download the latest version of PySpigot from GitHub or from Spigot. Drop the downloaded Jar file into your plugins folder and start your server.

## Creating Your First Script

In this brief tutorial, we will create a script that creates a command to teleport a player to a given location.

### Create Script File

All scripts are located in the `scripts` folder within PySpigot's main plugin folder.

Create a Python script file here and name it whatever you would like. The file name serves as the name for that script, which will be used to load and unload the script later.

!> PySpigot will only load and run script files that end in `.py`. You can easily disable a script without deleting it by changing the file extension (for example, by adding `.disabled`) to the end of the file.

### Write The Script

Using the text editor of your choice, open the script file you just created.
